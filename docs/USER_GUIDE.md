# Nexus AI - User Guide

Nexus AI is your autonomous AI workspace where agents collaborate to solve complex problems. This guide covers everything you need to know as a user.

## Core Concepts

### 1. The Orchestrator
The Orchestrator is the "brain" of Nexus AI. When you submit a request, it analyzes the complexity and decides whether to handle it as a single **Task** or a multi-phase **Project**.

### 2. Agents
Agents are specialized AI personas with different skills:
- **ResearcherAgent**: Gathers data from the web.
- **CodeAgent**: Writes and debugs code.
- **ContentAgent**: Drafts emails, blogs, and reports.
- **ManagerAgent**: Plans and coordinates project workflows.

### 3. Semantic Memory
Nexus AI remembers your preferences and past interactions. This means:
- It learns your preferred writing tone.
- It can reference solutions from similar tasks you've done before.
- It understands your project context without you re-explaining it.

## Key Features

### ✨ Smart Tasks
Submit any natural language prompt. The Orchestrator will:
- Determine which agent is best suited.
- Execute the work in the background.
- Store the result in your history.

### 🚀 Autonomous Projects
For complex goals, use Projects.
- **AI Planning**: The ManagerAgent breaks your goal into logical phases.
- **Workflow Execution**: Agents work sequentially or in parallel based on dependencies.
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Watch every step of the process through the Project Timeline.

### 🧠 Memory Exploration
Use the **Memory & Context** panel to:
- Browse your **Conversation History**.
- Configure **Learned Preferences**.
- Find **Related Tasks** using semantic search.
- View **Memory Analytics** to see how much the AI has learned about your workflow.

### 📂 File Management
Upload documents, images, or code files to projects. Agents can use these files as context for their work.

## Tips for Success
- **Be Specific**: Detailed prompts give agents better context.
- **Provide Feedback**: Rate agent outputs with 👍/👎 to help the memory system learn your preferences.
- **Use Projects for Big Goals**: If a task seems like it has multiple steps, create a Project instead of a single Chat message.
